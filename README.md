Magma code to construct toral elementary abelian subgroups in groups of Lie type

This algorithm enumerates toral elementary abelian p-subgroups in simply connected or adjoint
simple algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields of characteristic different from p.

This code accompanies the results of [Elementary abelian subgroups: from algebraic groups to finite groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02364), by J. An, H. Dietrich and A. Litterick.
